  Your situation is complicated. You may want to [talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm). If you do not respond to the Alaska case, the Alaska judge may enter a custody order.

      If the Alaska Court does not have jurisdiction and you want the court to dismiss the case, you can fill out and file a “**Motion to Dismiss**” that tells the court why you want to dismiss the case.

The parent's domestic violence behavior needs to fit under one of the domestic violence crimes in the law.

  Can we combine into AKA2J branding for starting custody, answering custody, answering divorce? Starting divorce case paternity_step is paternity_testing_step and different enough it doesn't make sense to combine.
template: paternity_step
subject: |
  Step ${ paternity_idx }: Learn about paternity
content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>General Paternity Information</div>
  <p>Establishing paternity means legally determining the biological  father of a child, and can make a big difference in a child's health, financial  outlook and sense of identity in knowing who both parents are. Once established, the father's name can be  placed on the child's birth certificate and he has legal and financial  responsibility for the child.  Disestablishing paternity is legally un-naming a man as the child's  biological father.</p>
  % if user_need in('custody', 'divorce'):
  <p>When you file your complaint, state that paternity is an issue in section 3D of the complaint.
  % endif
  % if user_need == 'answer custody':
  <div class='step-subheading'>Establishing or disestablishing paternity in your custody case</div>
  When you file your Answer, state that paternity is an issue in section 4 of the Counterclaims section of the Answer.
 
  You can prove or disprove paternity several ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Each  parent signs an affidavit stating the biological father.  Fill out:</li>

    </ul>
    <li> The  mother, child, and person who may be the father take a DNA test using a  painless swab inside the cheek. The whole process takes about 15 minutes and  the result is ready within about 3 weeks.  If someone is not cooperating or you want Child Support Services  Division to do the testing, fill out and attach these forms to your Answer:</li>
    <ul>

    <li>The person filing the Complaint attaches any DNA test results that have already been done.</li>
    % endif
  </ul>
  % endif

  <div class='step-subheading'>Change the Birth Certificate</div>
  If the court decides that the biological father is someone not listed on the birth certificate, you must send a copy of the court order to the  Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate. 
  
  After the birth certificate is changed, the child is considered &quot;legitimated&quot; and the heir of that father. This means that if the child should be eligible for any medical or financial benefits connected to the father such as health insurance, or benefits based on  military service or being Alaska Native or American Indian. Also, if the father dies, the child will be able to inherit and collect financial or medical benefits that the child may be eligible for such as Social Security Children's  Insurance Benefits or military benefits. If you do not notify Health Analytics &amp; Vital Records to change the birth certificate, the child may miss out on these benefits.

Generally, only the court in the state where the child has lived for the last 6 months has jurisdiction to make decisions, enter a parenting plan, or order child support.  This is called the child's "home state."

  Jurisdiction can be very complicated. For example, if a baby is less than 6 months old and has moved between states, there may not be a “home state.” This is one example of an exception when the Alaska court may be able to decide issues about a child that hasn't lived here for 6 months.
  
  If you and ${ other_party_in_case } disagree about which state, the courts will decide after hearing both side's arguments.

  2.	Fill out and file a Motion to Dismiss with your Answer

      * Use: **Motion, SHC-1300** [Word](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300.doc) | [PDF](http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1300n.pdf), and title it “Motion to Dismiss.”

   <div class="step-subheading">What to expect</div>

   * Every case is different, but sometimes it is clear only one of the courts has jurisdiction over the case. When this happens, one state court may close its case.
   * If it is not clear, the Alaska court will often hold a hearing and call the other court to talk about which case will move forward.
   * It is important to pay attention to what is happening in both cases until you know which state will decide the case.
   * Jurisdiction can be very complicated.  Talking to a lawyer can help you decide which is the best state for your case.

  If you and ${ other_party_in_case } agree on everything (a parenting plan including decision-making and schedule, paternity, and child support), you can fill out forms to start the case together.  This is called an uncontested case.
  
  You will not know your case number until you file your documents with the court.  You can write the case number on all your forms then.
