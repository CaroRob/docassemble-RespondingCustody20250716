question: |
  Responding in your child custody case
subquestion: |
  This Guided Assistant asks you questions and uses your answers to build a Personal Action Plan - a list of steps to help you respond in your child custody case. Your Action Plan will include information about the Alaska court process and other resources.
  
  What information do you need?
fields: 
  - no label: type_of_response
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - "The other parent started a custody case and I want to respond.": ak custody case
      - "The other parent started a custody case, but did not give me the filed documents in the correct way.": improper service
        help: |
          The other parent is supposed to give you a copy by process server, or send it by certified mail/restricted delivery/return receipt. 
      - "The other parent started a custody case in Alaska, but I think the case should be in a different state.": wrong state
      - "2 custody cases were filed – Alaska and another state.": case in 2 states
      - "The other parent started a custody case against me, I did not respond, and I got papers about a 'default judgment.'": default
    none of the above: |
      The other parent has not started a custody case yet, but wants to see if we can agree on a parenting plan and custody order.

  #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
  We provide information about the process in Alaska only. Look for information in other states on their [court](https://www.ncsc.org/information-and-resources/state-court-websites) and [legal aid programs'](https://lawhelp.org) websites.
validation code: | 
  if type_of_response['wrong state'] and type_of_response['case in 2 states']:

  Why does it matter where our children live?
  
  The court may not have the authority to make decisions in your case if your children have not lived in Alaska long enough.

  I think we do not need this question if we present choices as checkboxes at the beginning of the interview.
id: No jurisdiction
question: |
  Information about jurisdiction has been added to your Action Plan
subquestion: |
  Generally, your children have to live in Alaska for at least the last 6 months for the Alaska courts to have the authority, called “jurisdiction,” to decide your case.

  If you think your case may be an exception, you may want to talk to a lawyer or contact the Alaska Family Law Self-Help Center.

  law presumes that a parent with a "history of domestic violence" may not get custody and unsupervised visitation without completing some court-approved treatment.

The court can find domestic violence based on one parent’s testimony even if there was no protective order or criminal case.
